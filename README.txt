When I was playing around with the /enchant command, I noticed that it didn't let you enchant anything past what would be possible normally. I was extremely confused with this. Why is a feature made specifically for those going outside of the rules of survival being restrained to those same rules? As such, I made a command that fixed that. Since then, this mod has became much more than that.

 

This mod adds many new commands to enable better development. Currently, it adds the following:

 

Current Commands:

/enchantur: The reason for this mod being created. Exactly like the enchant command, but is completely unrestricted (with the sole exception of the 100k level limit, even though you should never reasonably reach that). 

/geteffectid: Gets the numerical ID of any potion effect you want. For... reasons, potions still use numerical IDs in their effects, so this can be helpful for that.

/unbreakable: Makes an item unbreakable. Not much to say here.

/effectinfinity: Exactly like the /effect command, but without any duration. Instead, it auto-applies it forever.

/nameraw: Like /tellraw, but names the item the target has in their main hand.

/loreraw: Like /tellraw and /nameraw, but with lore.

/potion, /splashpotion, /lingeringpotion: Like /effect, but gives the target a potion that does the effect.

/aggravate: Takes in two entities, and makes the first one attack the other. Can be altered to have them both attack each other with an extra parameter.

/setcount: Sets the count of the mainhand item of the target to the desired amount.

/health, /hunger, /saturation: Either sets the health, hunger, or saturation to 20, or sets them to a specific amount if that is added as an argument.

/getcolorcode: Takes in a hexadecimal color code, and does all of the work to turn it into one of MC's color codes, usable in potion effects and leather armor.

Extra Features/Notes:

-All potion effects and enchant levels have been localized up to Lv. 3998.

-/enchantur can add the same exact effect twice! 

 

FAQ:

Can you port this to [VERSION]?

If it's a newer version, I'm probably already working on it. If it's an older version (or any modloader other than Forge), no.

Can I port this to [VERSION]?

Yes, of course! Just credit me.

Can you add [NEW FEATURE]?

Feel free to ask me on the Github issue tracker. However, if it's too complex of a feature, I'll probably turn you down. There's a point in which it's just better to use the original commands.

Will this break my game?

I hope not, but there's always a small amount of warning I must give you. Just be careful, and use common sense. No, that doesn't mean to mine with a Fortune 100000 pickaxe.

Can I do the things this mod does without it?

Yes. This mod doesn't really add any new features, just makes old ones more accessible.
